# Airport-Database-Project
Worked with a team of 4 people to create a database application that portrays the database system of a fictional airport (named the Biden Airport). â€¢	A user can enter information of any attribute (e.g., flight number, passenger ID, etc.) and get information regarding the entity or entities in which the attribute is part of.
