# Airport-Database-Project
Worked with a team of 4 people to create a database application that portrays the database system of a fictional airport (named the Biden Airport). Java, SQL, HTML, and CSS were used to create the application. A user can enter information of any attribute (e.g., flight number, passenger ID, etc.) and get information regarding the entity or entities in which the attribute is part of. 
To be able to run the project, NetBeans needs to be downloaded first. Netbeans is an IDE that will allow you to run Java, SQL, and HTML.
After Netbeans is downloaded, GlassFish server will also need to be downloaded. After it is downloaded, connect GlassFish to the Java DB in Netbeans by going to Properties and setting the download location to the GlassFish file that was downloaded.
Once GlassFish is working, right-click on Java DB and click ‘Create Database. Set the name to ‘AirportDatabase’, the username to ‘username’, and the password to ‘password’.
Once AirportDatabase is created, right-click on it and click ‘Execute Command’. Take the contents of the AirportSql.sql file and put it into the window that pops up. Click the ‘Run SQL’ file to create the tables and populate them with tuples.
Next, go to ‘Open Project’ and open the project titled ‘Airport Project’. Right-click on it and select the ‘Build’ option. After it finishes building, right-click on it and select the ‘Run’ option. The program will start running and a browser window will pop up.
